all the identities gets scrapped from the same function, if we handle the sync delay
from there, for | even the < will increment the sync delay also, 
maybe try create scrap function for each entity

keep in mind to handle single and double quotes also in the lexer, 

subject > Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell 
    from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
    means, if red_app or red_out or any of the operatiors, loses their value inside of the "", and convert
    into only strings, "<<"
