export $VARS export x 'abc'

in this case
    bash ignores all 

// rememeber this one needs to be modified, if someone created a folder in which = exists
            // it will be splited in the env also in exp
            // CHANGE IT AFTER

remember also to add the empty string if only space (in explist)
for example p=""
in env its fine

remember to add this: if no variable found from the append, it must be added
u can do that in the check of the flag (append), if the var is not found, that
flag must be desactivated so the other operation of adding a new variable will do
the job of adding it and not go append it
