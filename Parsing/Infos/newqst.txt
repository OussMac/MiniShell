void add_to_env(t_envlist **env, t_envlist *variable)
{
	if (!*env || !variable)
		return ;
	printf("didnt return\n");
	if (!*env)
	{	
		printf("here\n");
		get_last_node(*env)->next = variable;
	} // issue was here, and why ?
	else
	{
		printf("HERE\n");
		*env = variable;
	}
}

so if the env is NULL, how does the first if didnt return?
	cuz it gets to HERE
and since it always gets there, only the last part of the env gets
saved in the linked list first node

Answer
	the env thats sent, isnt initialized, so its not NULL, it has some
	garbage value, so it passes the first if and the second one since its
	not NULL, and then it gets to the third if and re write the first node
	always

Solution
	We can just init the env to NULL before calling the function that fills
	the Linkedenv.
